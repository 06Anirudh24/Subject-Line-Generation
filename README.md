# Subject-Line-Generation

This project is a part of my internship at Epsilon, Bangalore. In this work, the following tasks have been performed: 
- Built a transformer-based NLP model to generate diverse E-Mail subject lines given a theme or starting word(s) as the input.
- Built a model to generate semantically similar subject lines by considering text generation as an English-English neural machine
translation task.
- Built an LSTM-based classifier to group the advertisement E-Mails that use the generated subject lines into five classes by predicting the probability of a receiver opening the mail.

**NOTE: Due to the privacy policy of Epsilon, this repository does not contain the entire project work. Further, the codes that have been uploaded here are based on a small, publicly available dataset of less than 1000 sentences. The actual data set used in this work, however, consists of over 14 Million data points, and hence the models, when trained on them provide significantly better results.**
